# Gummy-Bear-Site

# # About

This repository is a collection of HTML and CSS code for a website that showcases gummi bears.

The code includes various styles for the website's header, navigation bar, images, sections, and footer. One of the key highlights of this code is the cool hover effects applied to the navigation links, which change the link's background color, border-radius, font size, and text color.

Another interesting aspect of this code is the mask effect applied to the images in the recipe and history sections, which creates a transparent overlay with a text caption on top of the image when the user hovers over it. The code is well-organized and uses Flexbox for layout and responsive design.

Overall, this repository provides a great example of how to create an engaging and visually appealing website using HTML and CSS.
