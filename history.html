        <h2>The Story of Gummy Bears</h2>
        <p>Gummy bears have been a beloved candy treat for generations, but their history actually dates back to the 1920s. In 1922, a German candy maker named Hans Riegel Sr. founded a company called Haribo, which stands for "Hans Riegel Bonn."</p>
        <p>At the time, Haribo was primarily focused on producing hard candies and licorice, but in 1925, Riegel had an idea for a new type of candy. Inspired by the popular dancing bears that were a common sight at festivals and carnivals in Europe, Riegel created a new candy in the shape of a bear. The candy was made from a combination of sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, and flavorings, and was chewy and sweet.</p>
        <p>The new candy quickly became a hit in Germany, and by the 1930s, Haribo was producing millions of gummy bears each year. The candy's popularity only grew from there, and by the 1980s, gummy bears had become one of the most popular candies in the world.</p>
        <p>Over the years, gummy bears have evolved to include a wide variety of flavors and shapes, but the original bear shape remains the most popular. Today, gummy bears are enjoyed by people of all ages and are a staple in candy stores and supermarkets around the world. The history of gummy bears is a sweet one, filled with innovation, creativity, and of course, lots of delicious candy.</p>
